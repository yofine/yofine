Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm a frontend engineer, specializing in building frontend infrastructure. I have tons of experience, ðŸ’ª and am always striving to learn new technologies and tools to keep up with industry developments.

Recently, I've been diving into web3, which is an incredibly promising field. ðŸš€ I believe blockchain technology has the potential to bring many opportunities and transformations, especially in the frontend domain. I hope to combine my frontend skills with web3 technology to develop innovative products and applications.

In my spare time, I have a hobby: model-making. ðŸ¤– I'm a Gundam model enthusiast and have made many models. It's not only a fun activity but also a way to exercise my patience and skills. ðŸŽ¨

Finally, if you're interested in my work or projects, feel free to check out my GitHub or connect with me on social media. Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜Š
